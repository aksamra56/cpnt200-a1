Additional Info: 
The nav elements provide a good categorisation for sub-elements, although they themselves are not web pages. They link to other pages in the sub-navigation menu however and add to the site structure, hence why they are included with their own colour code.
The search pages are considered to be single pages, that move to collections after the search is conducted.
